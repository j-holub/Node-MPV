# Node-MPV Changelog

* **2.0.0**
  * The 1.\*.\* API is no longer valid

  * Added a proper error message object to tell you what went wrong
  * The `statuschange` event was renamed to `status` and now fires for properties independently
  * `load()`, `append()`, `loadPlaylist()`, `prev()` and `next()` are a lot more robust and check if the file or stream could be played or not
  * Added the possibility to hook into a running instance of **mpv**
  * `start()` can also take mpv arguments
  * Support any protocol that **mpv** supports
  * `mute()`, `unmute()` and `toggleMute()` are now one function `mute()` that can take a boolean as an argument
  * `loop()` can now also toggle the mute state by not passing an argument
  * `loopPlaylist()` and `clearLoopPlaylist()` were combined into `loopPlaylist()`, which works exactly as `loop()`
  * Removed the IDs from `observeProperty()`. It's all handled in the background now
  * Added a lot of *Information Methods*
  * `goto()` was renamed to `jump()`
  * Removed *deprecated* methods from **Version1**, namely `loadFile()` and `loadStream()`

  * Removed `Promise` as a dependency
  * Removed `cuid` as a dependency
